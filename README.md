Angular Soap
------------

This is an simple example soap project with angular. This project uses jQuery SOAP plugin. An angular factory "wraps" the $.soap in combination with an angular promise ($q).

Installation
------------

Use the following command: `bower install`. If you want to test this locally, you will probably hit an CORS error. 
The work-around is, to start your browser (firefox, chrome) with `--disable-web-security` command, e.g.: `google-chrome --disable-web-security` (remember to turn it off when you are done!!)
